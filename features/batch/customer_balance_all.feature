  Scenario: Update Postage Balance After Each Print
    Given I am signed in as a batch shipper
    And I Add a new order
    Then Set Ship From to default
    Then Set Ship-To address to random
    And Click Ship-To Less link
    Then Set Service to "Priority Mail Package"
    Then Set Insured Value to $10.00
    Then Set Tracking to USPS Tracking
    And Save Shipping Costs Data
    Then Print
    Then Expect Printing cost is deducted from customer balance if there were no printing errors
    And Sign out
