Issues with Watir 6.2 + Chromedriver + Gheckodriver;
API wait_until_present and wait_while_present spits out error;
This code has slept for the duration of the default timeout waiting for an Element to exist. If the test is still passing, consider using Element#exists? instead of rescuing UnknownObjectException
Let me know if you see these errors.
